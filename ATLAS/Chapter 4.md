> > A vector space involves four things—two sets V and F, and two algebraic operations called vector addition and scalar multiplication.  
> > • V is a nonempty set of objects called vectors. Although V can be quite general, we will usually consider V to be a set of n-tuples or a set of matrices.  
> > • F is a scalar field—for us F is either the field  of real numbers or the field C of complex numbers.  
> > • Vector addition (denoted by x + y ) is an operation between elements of V.  
> > • Scalar multiplication (denoted by αx ) is an operation between elements of F and V.
