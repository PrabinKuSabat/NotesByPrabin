# Initial Questions 
1. Major planning scheduler and performance Validation.
2. Asymmetric Scheduler 
	1. AI codes -> AIQC
	2. QS codes -> QC
	3. Normal Programs -> AIQC & QC
3. Only changing the kernel may not work.
	1. May be we will have to modify bootloader?
	2. Opensbi has to be changed to give some of the CSR accesses.
4. Will we have to build everything from the start? 
	- Or can the opensbi and U-Boot be used ?
5. What are the different performance validations one can do for a new system, when there are not any architectural details?
6. Can I write a bootloader which works on any developer board?
7. Major problem is each vendor has OS for their boards but they are independently maintained and not updated after a specific time. Can we have a OS which can boot anywhere? 
   - Is this possible using AI or any other method?
   - And why each vendor has a modified Linux distr. for its boards?
