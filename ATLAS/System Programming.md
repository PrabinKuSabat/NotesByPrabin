# Chapter Wise Notes

## Chapter 2

1. [[Basic Assembler Functions]]  
	Section 2.1 focuses on the fundamental design of an assembler using the **SIC (Simplified Instructional Computer)** architecture. It transitions from theoretical machine structure to the practical software required to translate human-readable mnemonics into executable machine code.
2. [[Machine Depedent Assembler Features]]  
	Section 2.2 of the sources focuses on **Machine-Dependent Assembler Features**, specifically those required to support the **SIC/XE architecture**. These features are critical for both industry practitioners (understanding low-level optimization and memory management) and students preparing for exams (mastering displacement calculations and relocation logic).
