# Computer Vision

## 2024

1. [[Vision Mamba]] : Light-weight computer vision model

# NLP

1. Gemini 1.5 : large context processing

# New Methods

1. [[KAN (Kolmogorov Arnoid Networks)]] : a new way of proposing and processing data
	- using Kernel methods and differential equations.

# General Models

1. GEMMA models : focus on integrating safety and fairness into AI systems without compromising their performance.

# Multi-modal

1. Qwen 2 : developed by Alibaba, offers a modular and scalable architecture optimized for multi-modal tasks.
2. MixR A7B : presents an advanced modular architecture with “mixture-of-expert” techniques
	- allowing it to allocate computational resources dynamically based on the task at hand.
