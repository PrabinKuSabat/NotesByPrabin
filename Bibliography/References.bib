However, the performance degrades dramatically under real-world settings due to variations introduced by subtle facial appearance changes, head pose variations, illumination changes, and occlusions. In this paper, a novel island loss is proposed to enhance the discriminative power of deeply learned features. Specifically, the island loss is designed to reduce the intra-class variations while enlarging the inter-class differences simultaneously. Experimental results on four benchmark expression databases have demonstrated that the CNN with the proposed island loss (IL-CNN) outperforms the baseline CNN models with either traditional softmax loss or center loss and achieves comparable or better performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods for facial expression recognition.},

The proposed model consists of a feature extraction block, an information extraction block, and a reconstruction module. Firstly, the extraction block is used to extract useful features from low-resolution images, with multiple information extraction blocks being combined with the feature map attention mechanism and passed between feature channels. Secondly, the interdependence is used to adaptively adjust the channel characteristics to restore more details. Finally, the reconstruction module reforms different scales high-resolution images. The experimental results can demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively improve not only the visual effect of images but also the results on the Set5, Set14, Urban100, and Manga109. The results can demonstrate the proposed method has structurally similarity to the image reconstruction methods. Furthermore, the evaluating indicator of Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) has been improved to a certain degree, while the effectiveness of using feature map attention mechanism in image super-resolution reconstruction applications is useful and effective.},

  abstract = {In this work, we introduce Dual Attention Vision Transformers ~(DaViT), a simple yet effective vision transformer architecture that is able to capture global context while maintaining computational efficiency. We propose approaching the problem from an orthogonal angle: exploiting self-attention mechanisms with both ``spatial tokens'' and ``channel tokens''. With spatial tokens, the spatial dimension defines the token scope, and the channel dimension defines the token feature dimension. With channel tokens, we have the inverse: the channel dimension defines the token scope, and the spatial dimension defines the token feature dimension. We further group tokens along the sequence direction for both spatial and channel tokens to maintain the linear complexity of the entire model. We show that these two self-attentions complement each other: (i) since each channel token contains an abstract representation of the entire image, the channel attention naturally captures global interactions and representations by taking all spatial positions into account when computing attention scores between channels; (ii) the spatial attention refines the local representations by performing fine-grained interactions across spatial locations, which in turn helps the global information modeling in channel attention. Extensive experiments show DaViT backbones achieve state-of-the-art performance on four different tasks. Specially, DaViT-Tiny, DaViT-Small, and DaViT-Base achieve 82.8\%, 84.2\%, and 84.6\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K without extra training data, using 28.3M, 49.7M, and 87.9M parameters, respectively. When we further scale up DaViT with 1.5B weakly supervised image and text pairs, DaViT-Giant reaches 90.4\% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. Code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/DaViT.},

  abstract = {Significance             Though people regularly recognize many distinct emotions, for the most part, research studies have been limited to six basic categories---happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear, and disgust; the reason for this is grounded in the assumption that only these six categories are differentially represented by our cognitive and social systems. The results reported herein propound otherwise, suggesting that a larger number of categories is used by humans.           ,              Understanding the different categories of facial expressions of emotion regularly used by us is essential to gain insights into human cognition and affect as well as for the design of computational models and perceptual interfaces. Past research on facial expressions of emotion has focused on the study of six basic categories---happiness, surprise, anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. However, many more facial expressions of emotion exist and are used regularly by humans. This paper describes an important group of expressions, which we call compound emotion categories. Compound emotions are those that can be constructed by combining basic component categories to create new ones. For instance, happily surprised and angrily surprised are two distinct compound emotion categories. The present work defines 21 distinct emotion categories. Sample images of their facial expressions were collected from 230 human subjects. A Facial Action Coding System analysis shows the production of these 21 categories is different but consistent with the subordinate categories they represent (e.g., a happily surprised expression combines muscle movements observed in happiness and surprised). We show that these differences are sufficient to distinguish between the 21 defined categories. We then use a computational model of face perception to demonstrate that most of these categories are also visually discriminable from one another.},

  abstract = {Tensor processing units (TPUs) are one of the most well-known machine learning (ML) accelerators utilized at large scale in data centers as well as in tiny ML applications. TPUs offer several improvements and advantages over conventional ML accelerators, like graphical processing units (GPUs), being designed specifically to perform the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations required in the matrix-matrix and matrix-vector multiplies extensively present throughout the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs). Such improvements include maximizing data reuse and minimizing data transfer by leveraging the temporal dataflow paradigms provided by the systolic array architecture. While this design provides a significant performance benefit, the current implementations are restricted to a single dataflow consisting of either input, output, or weight stationary architectures. This can limit the achievable performance of DNN inference and reduce the utilization of compute units. Therefore, the work herein consists of developing a reconfigurable dataflow TPU, called the Flex-TPU, which can dynamically change the dataflow per layer during run-time. Our experiments thoroughly test the viability of the Flex-TPU comparing it to conventional TPU designs across multiple well-known ML workloads. The results show that our Flex-TPU design achieves a significant performance increase of up to 2.75x compared to conventional TPU, with only minor area and power overheads.},

We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

Their many-core architecture supports a large number of threads that run concurrently to hide the latency among dependent instructions. In modern GPU architectures, each SM/core is typically composed of several sub-cores, where each sub-core has its own independent pipeline. Simulators are a key tool for investigating novel concepts in computer architecture. They must be performance-accurate and have a proper model related to the target hardware to explore the different bottlenecks properly. This paper presents a wide analysis of different parts of Accel-sim, a popular GPGPU simulator, and some improvements of its model. First, we focus on the front-end and developed a more realistic model. Then, we analyze the way the result bus works and develop a more realistic one. Next, we describe the current memory pipeline model and propose a model for a more cost-effective design. Finally, we discuss other areas of improvement of the simulator.},

  abstract = {The central building block of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the convolution operator, which enables networks to construct informative features by fusing both spatial and channel-wise information within local receptive fields at each layer. A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the "Squeeze-and-Excitation" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251\%, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of {\textasciitilde}25\%.

This rapid architectural and technological progression, coupled with a reluctance by manufacturers to disclose low-level details, makes it difficult for even the most proficient GPU software designers to remain up-to-date with the technological advances at a microarchitectural level. To address this dearth of public, microarchitectural-level information on the novel NVIDIA GPUs, independent researchers have resorted to microbenchmarks-based dissection and discovery. This has led to a prolific line of publications that shed light on instruction encoding, and memory hierarchy's geometry and features at each level. Namely, research that describes the performance and behavior of the Kepler, Maxwell and Pascal architectures. In this technical report, we continue this line of research by presenting the microarchitectural details of the NVIDIA Volta architecture, discovered through microbenchmarks and instruction set disassembly. Additionally, we compare quantitatively our Volta findings against its predecessors, Kepler, Maxwell and Pascal.},

  abstract = {Many architects believe that major improvements in cost-energy-performance must now come from domain-specific hardware. This paper evaluates a custom ASIC---called a Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)---deployed in datacenters since 2015 that accelerates the inference phase of neural networks (NN). The heart of the TPU is a 65,536 8-bit MAC matrix multiply unit that offers a peak throughput of 92 TeraOps/second (TOPS) and a large (28 MiB) software-managed on-chip memory. The TPU's deterministic execution model is a better match to the 99th-percentile response-time requirement of our NN applications than are the time-varying optimizations of CPUs and GPUs (caches, out-of-order execution, multithreading, multiprocessing, prefetching, ...) that help average throughput more than guaranteed latency. The lack of such features helps explain why, despite having myriad MACs and a big memory, the TPU is relatively small and low power. We compare the TPU to a server-class Intel Haswell CPU and an Nvidia K80 GPU, which are contemporaries deployed in the same datacenters. Our workload, written in the high-level TensorFlow framework, uses production NN applications (MLPs, CNNs, and LSTMs) that represent 95\% of our datacenters' NN inference demand. Despite low utilization for some applications, the TPU is on average about 15X - 30X faster than its contemporary GPU or CPU, with TOPS/Watt about 30X - 80X higher. Moreover, using the GPU's GDDR5 memory in the TPU would triple achieved TOPS and raise TOPS/Watt to nearly 70X the GPU and 200X the CPU.},

  abstract = {Automatic understanding of human affect using visual signals is a problem that has attracted significant interest over the past 20 years. However, human emotional states are quite complex. To appraise such states displayed in real-world settings, we need expressive emotional descriptors that are capable of capturing and describing this complexity. The circumplex model of affect, which is described in terms of valence (i.e., how positive or negative is an emotion) and arousal (i.e., power of the activation of the emotion), can be used for this purpose. Recent progress in the emotion recognition domain has been achieved through the development of deep neural architectures and the availability of very large training databases. To this end, Aff-Wild has been the first large-scale "in-the-wild" database, containing around 1,200,000 frames. In this paper, we build upon this database, extending it with 260 more subjects and 1,413,000 new video frames. We call the union of Aff-Wild with the additional data, Aff-Wild2. The videos are downloaded from Youtube and have large variations in pose, age, illumination conditions, ethnicity and profession. Both database-specific as well as cross-database experiments are performed in this paper, by utilizing the Aff-Wild2, along with the RECOLA database. The developed deep neural architectures are based on the joint training of state-of-the-art convolutional and recurrent neural networks with attention mechanism; thus exploiting both the invariant properties of convolutional features, while modeling temporal dynamics that arise in human behaviour via the recurrent layers. The obtained results show premise for utilization of the extended Aff-Wild, as well as of the developed deep neural architectures for visual analysis of human behaviour in terms of continuous emotion dimensions.},

This new formulation directly uses box coordinates as queries in Transformer decoders and dynamically updates them layer-by-layer. Using box coordinates not only helps using explicit positional priors to improve the query-to-feature similarity and eliminate the slow training convergence issue in DETR, but also allows us to modulate the positional attention map using the box width and height information. Such a design makes it clear that queries in DETR can be implemented as performing soft ROI pooling layer-by-layer in a cascade manner. As a result, it leads to the best performance on MS-COCO benchmark among the DETR-like detection models under the same setting, e.g., AP 45.7{\textbackslash}\% using ResNet50-DC5 as backbone trained in 50 epochs. We also conducted extensive experiments to confirm our analysis and verify the effectiveness of our methods. Code is available at {\textbackslash}url\{https://github.com/SlongLiu/DAB-DETR\}.},

  abstract = {Dynamic facial expression recognition (FER) databases provide important data support for affective computing and applications. However, most FER databases are annotated with several basic mutually exclusive emotional categories and contain only one modality, e.g., videos. The monotonous labels and modality cannot accurately imitate human emotions and fulfill applications in the real world. In this paper, we propose MAFW, a large-scale multi-modal compound affective database with 10,045 video-audio clips in the wild. Each clip is annotated with a compound emotional category and a couple of sentences that describe the subjects' affective behaviors in the clip. For the compound emotion annotation, each clip is categorized into one or more of the 11 widely-used emotions, i.e., anger, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, surprise, contempt, anxiety, helplessness, and disappointment. To ensure high quality of the labels, we filter out the unreliable annotations by an Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, and then obtain 11 single-label emotion categories and 32 multi-label emotion categories. To the best of our knowledge, MAFW is the first in-the-wild multi-modal database annotated with compound emotion annotations and emotion-related captions. Additionally, we also propose a novel Transformer-based expression snippet feature learning method to recognize the compound emotions leveraging the expression-change relations among different emotions and modalities. Extensive experiments on MAFW database show the advantages of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art methods for both uni- and multi-modal FER.

This study presents a comprehensive, multi-level microbenchmarking analysis of the NVIDIA Hopper GPU architecture, delving into its performance characteristics and novel features. We benchmark Hopper's memory subsystem latency and throughput, comparing its L2 partitioned cache behavior and global memory access patterns against recent GPU generations, Ampere and Ada Lovelace. Our analysis reveals significant performance differences and architectural improvements in Hopper. A core contribution of this work is a detailed evaluation of Hopper's fourth-generation tensor cores, including their FP8 precision support and the novel asynchronous wgmma instructions, assessing their impact on matrix multiply-accumulate operations. We further investigate the performance implications of other key Hopper innovations: DPX instructions for accelerating dynamic programming algorithms, distributed shared memory (DSM) for inter-SM communication, and the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) for asynchronous data movement. This multi-level approach encompasses instruction-level microbenchmarks, library-level analysis of the Transformer Engine, and application-level benchmarks of tensor core performance within large language models. Our findings provide valuable, in-depth insights for software developers seeking to optimize performance and develop accurate performance models for the Hopper architecture, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of its potential for accelerating AI and other computationally intensive workloads.},

We introduce FlipHash, a consistent range-hashing algorithm with constant time complexity and low memory requirements. Like Jump Consistent Hash, FlipHash is intended for applications where resources can be indexed sequentially. Under this condition, it ensures that keys are hashed evenly across resources and that changing the number of resources only causes keys to be remapped from a removed resource or to an added one, but never shuffled across persisted ones. FlipHash differentiates itself with its low computational cost, achieving constant-time complexity. We show that FlipHash beats Jump Consistent Hash's cost, which is logarithmic in the number of resources, both theoretically and in experiments over practical settings.},

RNN computations involve both intra-timestep and inter-timestep dependencies. Due to these features, hardware acceleration of RNNs is more challenging than that of CNNs. Recently, several researchers have proposed hardware architectures for RNNs. In this paper, we present a survey of GPU/FPGA/ASIC-based accelerators and optimization techniques for RNNs. We highlight the key ideas of different techniques to bring out their similarities and differences. Improvements in deep-learning algorithms have inevitably gone hand-in-hand with the improvements in the hardware-accelerators. Nevertheless, there is a need and scope of even greater synergy between these two fields. This survey seeks to synergize the efforts of researchers in the area of deep learning, computer architecture, and chip-design.},

However, focusing on the saliency of an image is not enough. On the one hand, the salient features extracted from the model are not necessarily the features needed, e.g., a similar background may also be mistaken as salient features; on the other hand, various salient features are often more conducive to improving the performance of the model. Based on this, in this paper, a model that has joint weak saliency and attention aware is proposed, which can obtain more complete global features by weakening saliency features. The model then obtains diversified saliency features via attention diversity to improve the performance of the model. Experiments on commonly used datasets prove the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Hardware manufacturers, out of necessity, switched their focus to accelerators, a new paradigm that pursues specialization and heterogeneity over generality and homogeneity. They are special-purpose hardware structures separated from the CPU with aspects that exhibit a high degree of variability. We define a taxonomy based on fourteen of these aspects, grouped in four macro-categories: general aspects, host coupling, architecture, and software aspects. According to it, we categorize around 100 accelerators of the last decade from both industry and academia, and critically analyze emerging trends. We complete our discussion with throughput and efficiency figures. Then, we discuss some prominent open challenges that accelerators are facing, analyzing state-of-the-art solutions, and suggesting prospective research directions for the future.},

In this period Jupiter has delivered 5x higher speed and capacity, 30\% reduction in capex, 41\% reduction in power, incremental deployment and technology refresh all while serving live production traffic. A key enabler for these improvements is evolving Jupiter from a Clos to a direct-connect topology among the machine aggregation blocks. Critical architectural changes for this include: A datacenter interconnection layer employing Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based Optical Circuit Switches (OCSes) to enable dynamic topology reconfiguration, centralized Software-Defined Networking (SDN) control for traffic engineering, and automated network operations for incremental capacity delivery and topology engineering. We show that the combination of traffic and topology engineering on direct-connect fabrics achieves similar throughput as Clos fabrics for our production traffic patterns. We also optimize for path lengths: 60\% of the traffic takes direct path from source to destination aggregation blocks, while the remaining transits one additional block, achieving an average block-level path length of 1.4 in our fleet today. OCS also achieves 3x faster fabric reconfiguration compared to pre-evolution Clos fabrics that used a patch panel based interconnect.},

  abstract = {Attention mechanism, especially channel attention, has gained great success in the computer vision field. Many works focus on how to design efficient channel attention mechanisms while ignoring a fundamental problem, i.e., channel attention mechanism uses scalar to represent channel, which is difficult due to massive information loss. In this work, we start from a different view and regard the channel representation problem as a compression process using frequency analysis. Based on the frequency analysis, we mathematically prove that the conventional global average pooling is a special case of the feature decomposition in the frequency domain. With the proof, we naturally generalize the compression of the channel attention mechanism in the frequency domain and propose our method with multi-spectral channel attention, termed as FcaNet. FcaNet is simple but effective. We can change a few lines of code in the calculation to implement our method within existing channel attention methods. Moreover, the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results compared with other channel attention methods on image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation tasks. Our method could consistently outperform the baseline SENet, with the same number of parameters and the same computational cost. Our code and models will are publicly available at https://github.com/cfzd/FcaNet.},

  abstract = {In recent years, vision transformers have been introduced into face recognition and analysis and have achieved performance breakthroughs. However, most previous methods generally train a single model or an ensemble of models to perform the desired task, which ignores the synergy among different tasks and fails to achieve improved prediction accuracy, increased data efficiency, and reduced training time. This paper presents a multi-purpose algorithm for simultaneous face recognition, facial expression recognition, age estimation, and face attribute estimation (40 attributes including gender) based on a single Swin Transformer. Our design, the SwinFace, consists of a single shared backbone together with a subnet for each set of related tasks. To address the conflicts among multiple tasks and meet the different demands of tasks, a Multi-Level Channel Attention (MLCA) module is integrated into each task-specific analysis subnet, which can adaptively select the features from optimal levels and channels to perform the desired tasks. Extensive experiments show that the proposed model has a better understanding of the face and achieves excellent performance for all tasks. Especially, it achieves 90.97\% accuracy on RAF-DB and 0.22 \${\textbackslash}epsilon\$-error on CLAP2015, which are state-of-the-art results on facial expression recognition and age estimation respectively.

It is proposed that a dynamic representation underlies perception of scenes. One component of this proposal is a coherence theory of attention, which asserts that unattended structures are volatile, and that focused attention is needed to stabilize them sufficiently to allow the perception of change. The other component is the assertion that vision makes use of virtual representation, a dynamic form of representation in which attention provides detailed, coherent descriptions of objects that are needed exactly when they are needed. A triadic architecture is proposed as one possible way to create such a representation. This architecture uses representations that are stable and representations that contain large amounts of visual detail. But at no point does it use representations that are both stable and contain large amounts of detail. In this view, the impression of having representations that are both stable and detailed is due to the careful coordination of attention.

This model states that the differentiated emotional states are the result of the successive outcomes of a series of stimulus evaluation checks. A CPM of emotion was then developed. The CPM postulates 5 functionally defined subsystems of an organism that are centrally involved in the emotional process: information processing, support, executive, action, and monitoring. Differences between this theory and discrete emotion theory are discussed, and the CPM is used to account for the semantic structure of natural language emotion terms. Two studies, involving 10 Ss who sorted emotion terms and 636 students who completed a questionnaire on situations that provoke emotional arousal, are cited, and results concerning antecedents and reactions are noted.

This paper compares CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs and TPUs, their hardware architectures, their similarities and differences will be discussed. Modern neural networks are immensely used these days but they require more time, computation and energy. Due to the greater demand and attractive options for architects to explore, companies are continuously working to reduce training and inference response time. Due to the demands and cost factors different kinds of ASICs (application specific integrated circuits) are developed and research is increased in this area. Many models of CPUs, GPUs and TPUs have been developed to support these networks and to improve training and inference phase. Intel developed CPUs for this purpose, NVIDIA developed GPUs and Google developed cloud TPUs. The hardware of CPUs and GPUs can be sold to businesses while Google offers TPU processing for everyone from the cloud. When the data is away from the computational source, it increases the overall cost and to reduce this cost companies implements memory management and caching techniques close to ALUs.},

  abstract = {Many practical data-processing algorithms fail to execute efficiently on general-purpose CPUs (Central Processing Units) due to the sequential matter of their operations and memory bandwidth limitations. To achieve desired performance levels, reconfigurable (FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array)-based) hardware accelerators are frequently explored that permit the processing units' architectures to be better adapted to the specific problem/algorithm requirements. In particular, network-based data-processing algorithms are very well suited to implementation in reconfigurable hardware because several data-independent operations can easily and naturally be executed in parallel over as many processing blocks as actually required and technically possible. GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) have also demonstrated good results in this area but they tend to use significantly more power than FPGA, which could be a limiting factor in embedded applications. Moreover, GPUs employ a Single Instruction, Multiple Threads (SIMT) execution model and are therefore optimized to SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, while in FPGAs fully custom datapaths can be built, eliminating much of the control overhead. This review paper aims to analyze, compare, and discuss different approaches to implementing network-based hardware accelerators in FPGA and programmable SoC (Systems-on-Chip). The performed analysis and the derived recommendations would be useful to hardware designers of future network-based hardware accelerators.},

  abstract = {A common task in signal processing is the estimation of the parameters of a probability distribution function. Perhaps the most frequently encountered estimation problem is the estimation of the mean of a signal in noise. In many parameter estimation problems the situation is more complicated because direct access to the data necessary to estimate the parameters is impossible, or some of the data are missing. Such difficulties arise when an outcome is a result of an accumulation of simpler outcomes, or when outcomes are clumped together, for example, in a binning or histogram operation. There may also be data dropouts or clustering in such a way that the number of underlying data points is unknown (censoring and/or truncation). The EM (expectation-maximization) algorithm is ideally suited to problems of this sort, in that it produces maximum-likelihood (ML) estimates of parameters when there is a many-to-one mapping from an underlying distribution to the distribution governing the observation. The EM algorithm is presented at a level suitable for signal processing practitioners who have had some exposure to estimation theory.},

  abstract = {Many optical circuit switched data center networks (DCN) have been proposed in the past to attain higher capacity and topology reconfigurability, though commercial adoption of these architectures have been minimal. One major challenge these architectures face is the difficulty of handling uncertain traffic demands using commercial optical circuit switches (OCS) with high switching latency. Prior works have generally focused on developing fast-switching OCS prototypes to quickly react to traffic changes through frequent reconfigurations. This approach, however, adds tremendous complexity to the control plane, and raises the barrier for commercial adoption of optical circuit switched data center networks. We propose COUDER, a robust topology and routing optimization framework for reconfigurable optical circuit switched data centers. COUDER optimizes topology and routing based on a convex set of traffic matrices, and offers strict throughput guarantees for any future traffic matrices bounded by the convex set. For the bursty traffic demands that are unbounded by the convex set, we employ a desensitization technique to reduce performance hit. This enables COUDER to generate topology and routing solutions capable of handling unexpected traffic changes without relying on frequent topology reconfigurations. Our extensive evaluations based on Facebook's production DCN traces show that, even with daily reconfiguration, COUDER achieves about 20{\textbackslash}\% higher throughput, and about 32{\textbackslash}\% lower average hop count compared to cost-equivalent static topologies. Our work shows that adoption of reconfigurable topologies in commercial DCNs is feasible even without fast OCSs.},

LaMDA is a family of Transformer-based neural language models specialized for dialog, which have up to 137B parameters and are pre-trained on 1.56T words of public dialog data and web text. While model scaling alone can improve quality, it shows less improvements on safety and factual grounding. We demonstrate that fine-tuning with annotated data and enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources can lead to significant improvements towards the two key challenges of safety and factual grounding. The first challenge, safety, involves ensuring that the model's responses are consistent with a set of human values, such as preventing harmful suggestions and unfair bias. We quantify safety using a metric based on an illustrative set of human values, and we find that filtering candidate responses using a LaMDA classifier fine-tuned with a small amount of crowdworker-annotated data offers a promising approach to improving model safety. The second challenge, factual grounding, involves enabling the model to consult external knowledge sources, such as an information retrieval system, a language translator, and a calculator. We quantify factuality using a groundedness metric, and we find that our approach enables the model to generate responses grounded in known sources, rather than responses that merely sound plausible. Finally, we explore the use of LaMDA in the domains of education and content recommendations, and analyze their helpfulness and role consistency.},

To enable the Apollo optical switching layer, we employ circulators to realize bidirectional links through the OCS, effectively doubling the OCS radix. The OCS and circulator design choices were critical for meeting network bandwidth, scale, and cost targets. We review the critical co-design of WDM transceiver technology for these OCS plus circulator-based bidirectional links and their corresponding physical impairments, delivered over four generations/speeds of optical interconnect.

Micro-architecture research in the presence of SGX is an interesting theme to explore as SGX does not mitigate timing side-channel attacks at various levels of a memory hierarchy and causes significant performance slowdown. The research community extensively uses existing benchmark suites like SPEC CPU 2017 for evaluating new proposals on the various aspects of micro-architecture research. As there is no benchmark suite available for micro-architecture research with SGX, state-of-the-art micro-architecture research in the presence of SGX assumes an entire SPEC benchmark is running inside an enclave. In reality, Intel SGX assumes that a major portion of the application's code and data do not require security, and only a tiny fraction of it needs security via an enclave. To the best of our knowledge, there are no open-source micro-architectural simulators that can simulate Intel SGX fairly, for micro-architecture research. In this regard, we propose EnclaveSim, a detailed yet flexible, trace-based micro-architectural simulator that simulates trusted code execution through enclaves.},

  abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in computer vision community, significantly improving the state-of-the-art. In most of the available CNNs, the softmax loss function is used as the supervision signal to train the deep model. In order to enhance the discriminative power of the deeply learned features, this paper proposes a new supervision signal, called center loss, for face recognition task. Specifically, the center loss simultaneously learns a center for deep features of each class and penalizes the distances between the deep features and their corresponding class centers. More importantly, we prove that the proposed center loss function is trainable and easy to optimize in the CNNs. With the joint supervision of softmax loss and center loss, we can train a robust CNNs to obtain the deep features with the two key learning objectives, inter-class dispension and intra-class compactness as much as possible, which are very essential to face recognition. It is encouraging to see that our CNNs (with such joint supervision) achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on several important face recognition benchmarks, Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW), YouTube Faces (YTF), and MegaFace Challenge. Especially, our new approach achieves the best results on MegaFace (the largest public domain face benchmark) under the protocol of small training set (contains under 500000 images and under 20000 persons), significantly improving the previous results and setting new state-of-the-art for both face recognition and face verification tasks.},

Firstly, multiple classes share inherently similar underlying facial appearance, and their differences could be subtle. Secondly, facial expressions exhibit themselves through multiple facial regions simultaneously, and the recognition requires a holistic approach by encoding high-order interactions among local features. To address these issues, we propose our DAN with three key components: Feature Clustering Network (FCN), Multi-head cross Attention Network (MAN), and Attention Fusion Network (AFN). The FCN extracts robust features by adopting a large-margin learning objective to maximize class separability. In addition, the MAN instantiates a number of attention heads to simultaneously attend to multiple facial areas and build attention maps on these regions. Further, the AFN distracts these attentions to multiple locations before fusing the attention maps to a comprehensive one. Extensive experiments on three public datasets (including AffectNet, RAF-DB, and SFEW 2.0) verified that the proposed method consistently achieves state-of-the-art facial expression recognition performance.
