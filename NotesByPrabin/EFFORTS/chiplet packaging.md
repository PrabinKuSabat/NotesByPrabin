Chiplet packaging refers to an advanced semiconductor packaging technique that involves the use of small integrated circuit (IC) dies, known as chiplets, which can be combined to create more complex systems. This approach contrasts with traditional monolithic designs, where all components are integrated into a single die.

# Key Features of Chiplet Packaging

1. **Modularity**: Chiplets are designed to be modular, allowing manufacturers to mix and match different chiplets based on the specific requirements of a system. This modular approach resembles a "Lego-like" assembly, where various chiplets can be integrated into a single package, enhancing design flexibility and reducing time to market[](https://octopart.com/pulse/p/what-are-chiplets-and-how-are-they-used-in-packaging)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiplet).
2. **Heterogeneous Integration**: Chiplets can be fabricated using different processes and materials, optimizing each for its specific function. This allows for the integration of diverse functionalities within a single package, such as processing cores, memory, and I/O interfaces, each tailored for performance and efficiency[](https://evatecnet.com/media/rhrb4ism/evatec-layers7-ap-chiplets.pdf)[](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiplet).
3. **Cost Efficiency**: By utilizing reusable chiplets, manufacturers can significantly reduce the costs associated with design and verification. Instead of designing a new monolithic chip from scratch, companies can reuse existing chiplets, leading to lower manufacturing costs and higher yields per wafer[](https://octopart.com/pulse/p/what-are-chiplets-and-how-are-they-used-in-packaging)[](https://evatecnet.com/media/rhrb4ism/evatec-layers7-ap-chiplets.pdf)[](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/chiplets/).
4. **Packaging Technologies**: Various packaging technologies are employed to connect chiplets, including:
	 
	 - **Substrate Packaging**: Utilizes organic materials for connections, allowing for high-density interconnections.
	 - **Silicon Interposer Packaging**: Employs a silicon layer to facilitate communication between chiplets, offering higher I/O density and reduced power consumption.
	 - **Redistribution Layer (RDL) Packaging**: Directly deposits interconnects on the chiplet surface, enhancing signal integrity.
	 - **Embedded Multi-die Interconnect Bridge (EMIB)**: Combines substrate and interposer technologies for efficient die-to-die connections[](https://octopart.com/pulse/p/what-are-chiplets-and-how-are-they-used-in-packaging)[](https://evatecnet.com/media/rhrb4ism/evatec-layers7-ap-chiplets.pdf)[](https://www.eetimes.com/how-the-worlds-of-chiplets-and-packaging-intertwine/).
	 
5. **Challenges**: Despite its advantages, chiplet packaging presents challenges, including the need for complex design and testing processes, as well as ensuring interoperability between chiplets from different manufacturers[](https://semiengineering.com/knowledge_centers/packaging/advanced-packaging/chiplets/)
