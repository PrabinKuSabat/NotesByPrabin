GPT : Generative PreTrained Transformers  
2+1/2 years = 1 Generation in CS  
	15 years in human case

- Three types of AI
	1. ANI(Narrow)
	2. AGI(General)
	3. ASI(SuperIntelligence)
- ARIMA
	- AR : Autoregressive
	- I : Integrated
	- MA : Moving Average
	- Some key characteristics of ARIMA models:
		- Requires the time series to be stationary after differencing
		- Can model complex patterns in the data like trends and seasonality
		- Performs well for short-term forecasting
		- Computationally intensive to fit
		- Subjective in determining the optimal p, d, q parameters

- Types of DATA
	1. Structured
	2. Unstructured
	3. SemiStructured
	4. Time Series Data
	5. Sensor Data
	6. Transactional Data  
Combinations of Perceptrons make up a neural Network in DL.

# Life Lessons

Don't leave behind Indian Products.  
Widened Viewpoint is highly required and necessary.  
PI(Parent Intelligence)is nowhere less than AI.  
History Matters to make Matter Interesting.
