## Performance Characterisation and Simulation of Intel's Integrated GPU Architecture (2018)

This paper introduces the first open-source trace generation and microarchitectural simulation framework specifically designed for Intel's integrated GPUs[2](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Performance-Characterisation-and-Simulation-of-GPU-Gera-Kim/7879a4fcce4bc462ee6ae7f309427b0b078b97a0). The researchers conducted extensive performance characterization of Intel's Skylake and Kabylake GPUs through detailed microbenchmarks, using these evaluations to guide the development of their models and validate their simulator[2](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Performance-Characterisation-and-Simulation-of-GPU-Gera-Kim/7879a4fcce4bc462ee6ae7f309427b0b078b97a0). This pioneering work fills a significant gap in the research landscape, as prior to this study, there were no comprehensive open-source tools for analyzing Intel's integrated GPU architectures. The framework enables researchers and developers to better understand the performance characteristics of these widely deployed integrated GPUs, providing valuable insights for optimization and future architectural improvements[2](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Performance-Characterisation-and-Simulation-of-GPU-Gera-Kim/7879a4fcce4bc462ee6ae7f309427b0b078b97a0).

## Analyzing Modern NVIDIA GPU cores (2025)

Published in March 2025, this groundbreaking paper reverse engineers modern NVIDIA GPU cores, uncovering crucial aspects of their design and explaining how these GPUs leverage hardware-compiler techniques where the compiler guides hardware during execution[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20481). The research meticulously details key components including the issue logic, policy of the issue scheduler, structure of the register file and its associated cache, and multiple features of the memory pipeline[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20481). The authors also analyze how a simple instruction prefetcher based on a stream buffer aligns well with modern NVIDIA GPU architectures. By modeling these newly discovered microarchitectural details, the researchers achieved an impressive 18.24% lower mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) in execution cycles compared to previous state-of-the-art simulators, resulting in an average of 13.98% MAPE relative to real hardware (NVIDIA RTX A6000)[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20481). Additionally, the paper demonstrates that this new model is applicable to other NVIDIA architectures such as Turing, and provides evidence that the software-based dependence management mechanism included in modern NVIDIA GPUs outperforms hardware mechanisms based on scoreboards in terms of both performance and area efficiency[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20481).

# GPU Power Modeling

## AccelWattch: A Power Modeling Framework for Modern GPUs (2021)

Published on October 18, 2021, AccelWattch addresses two critical gaps in GPU power modeling: the lack of detailed and accurate cycle-level power models for modern GPU architectures and the inability to capture their constant and static power with existing tools[3](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/accelwattch-a-power-modeling-framework-for-modern-gpus). This configurable GPU power model can be driven by emulation and trace-driven environments, hardware counters, or a combination of these approaches[3](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/accelwattch-a-power-modeling-framework-for-modern-gpus). AccelWattch models both PTX and SASS instruction set architectures, accounts for power gating and control-flow divergence, and supports Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)[3](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/accelwattch-a-power-modeling-framework-for-modern-gpus). The researchers integrated AccelWattch with GPGPU-Sim and Accel-Sim to facilitate its widespread adoption and validated it on an NVIDIA Volta GPU, demonstrating strong correlation against hardware power measurements[3](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/accelwattch-a-power-modeling-framework-for-modern-gpus). The paper also showcases AccelWattch's capability to enable reliable design space exploration by accurately modeling power for GPU configurations resembling NVIDIA Pascal and Turing architectures, even when tuned initially for Volta GPUs[3](https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/accelwattch-a-power-modeling-framework-for-modern-gpus). This work represents a significant advancement in GPU power modeling, providing researchers and designers with a robust tool for evaluating both performance and power consumption—increasingly critical metrics in modern computing environments.
