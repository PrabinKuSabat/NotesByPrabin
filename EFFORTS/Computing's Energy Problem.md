1. Feature Scaling:  
	The rate of feature size scaling in computer architecture refers to the speed at which the minimum dimensions of transistors and other components on semiconductor chips are reduced.
	
	- Performance, Power, and Area (PPA): The reduction in feature size positively affects performance by enabling higher transistor density, leading to reduced power consumption per transistor. This allows for better energy efficiency and performance capabilities in modern computing systems.
	- Diminishing Returns: As the feature size approaches atomic scales, the traditional scaling methods yield diminishing returns, causing manufacturers to explore alternative technologies, such as 3D stacking, FinFET transistors, and even new semiconductor materials to achieve performance gains.
	- Economic Factors: The cost of implementing smaller feature sizes has also increased, requiring substantial investment in new fabrication technologies and facilities. This economic factor may restrict the pace of future scaling efforts.

2. Moore's law:  
	Introduced by Gordon Moore in 1965,	Mooreâ€™s Law stated that the number of transistors on a microchip would double approximately every year, leading to an increase in computational power and a decrease in relative cost.  
	In a 1975 revision, Moore adjusted this prediction, suggesting that the doubling would occur approximately every two years. This adjustment reflects the practical realities of semiconductor manufacturing and technology advancements over the decades

> [!note] Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography  
> Extreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) is a cutting-edge photolithography technology used in semiconductor fabrication to create intricate patterns on silicon wafers. By employing extremely short wavelengths of light in the extreme ultraviolet spectrum, specifically around 13.5 nanometers (nm). Comparing to DUV(Deep Ultraviolet Lithography) which uses 193nm, this allows for higher resolution.
