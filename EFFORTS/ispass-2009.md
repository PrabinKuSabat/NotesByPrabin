# ISPASS-2009 (GPU-Sim)

The ISVLSI/GPGPU-Sim 2009 benchmarks are a collection of diverse kernels used in the original GPGPU-Sim study[github.com](https://github.com/gpgpu-sim/ispass2009-benchmarks#:~:text=). This suite includes:

- **ispass-2009-AES** (CUDA AES encryption)
	 
- **ispass-2009-BFS** (breadth-first search)
	 
- **ispass-2009-LIB** (LIBOR market model)
	 
- **ispass-2009-LPS** (3D Laplace solver)
	 
- **ispass-2009-MUM** (MUMmerGPU; genome sequence matching)
	 
- **ispass-2009-NN** (neural network for digit recognition)
	 
- **ispass-2009-NQU** (N-Queens solver)
	 
- **ispass-2009-RAY** (ray casting)
	 
- **ispass-2009-STO** (STO solver)
	 
- **ispass-2009-WP** (watershed particle? â€“ as per original suite)
