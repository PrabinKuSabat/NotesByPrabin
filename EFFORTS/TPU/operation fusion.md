# Introduction

**Operator fusion** (also known as **operation fusion**) is an optimization technique used in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow to improve the performance of computations by combining multiple operations into a single operation.

# Importance

1. **Reduced Memory Access**:
	- Fusing operations can reduce the need for intermediate memory storage. In many cases, the intermediate results of one operation (e.g., the result of a matrix multiplication) are immediately used by the next operation (e.g., an activation function).
2. **Reduced Kernel Launches**:
	 - In frameworks like TensorFlow, operations on hardware (e.g., GPUs or TPUs) are executed as kernels. Each operation can trigger a kernel launch, which involves some overhead. By fusing operations, fewer kernel launches are needed, thus reducing this overhead.
3. **Improved Parallelism**:
	- Fusing operations enables better utilization of available parallel processing resources (e.g., SIMD or multi-core processing) in modern hardware.
4. **Optimized Computational Graph**:
	 - TensorFlow, for example, can optimize the computation graph by automatically fusing operations in the background, leading to more efficient execution.

# Example of Operator Fusion

- **Conv2D + Bias Add + Activation**: Convolution followed by bias addition and activation (like ReLU) can often be fused into a single kernel.
- **Batch Normalization + Activation**: Batch normalization followed by an activation function can be fused.
- **Element-wise operations**: Operations like addition, multiplication, and other element-wise computations can be fused into one if they are applied to the same tensors in sequence.
