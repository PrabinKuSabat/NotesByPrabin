11. What are work-items, work-groups, wavefront?
    > WaveFront: Group of threads that are executed simultaneously using SIMD
12. Lock-step execution
13. Thread divergence
    > Thread divergence is a phenomenon that occurs in parallel computing when different threads in a warp take different paths through the code. This can happen when a thread encounters a conditional statement and the condition evaluates to different values for different threads.
