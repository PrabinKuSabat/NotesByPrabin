**RDNA 3** is a [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit "Graphics processing unit") microarchitecture designed by [AMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMD "AMD"), released with the [Radeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon "Radeon") [RX 7000 series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon_RX_7000_series "Radeon RX 7000 series") on December 13, 2022. Alongside powering the RX 7000 series, RDNA 3 is also featured in the SoCs designed by AMD for the [Asus ROG Ally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asus_ROG_Ally "Asus ROG Ally") and [Lenovo Legion Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenovo_Legion "Lenovo Legion") consoles.  
AMD announced to investors their intention to achieve a performance-per-watt uplift of over 50% with RDNA 3 and that the upcoming architecture would be built using [[chiplet packaging]] on a 5 nm process.  
Full details for the RDNA 3 architecture were unveiled on November 3, 2022 at an event in [Las Vegas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas "Las Vegas").

# Chiplet Packaging

The decision to move to a chiplet-based GPU microarchitecture was led by AMD Senior Vice President [Sam Naffziger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Naffziger "Sam Naffziger") who had also lead the chiplet initiative with Ryzen and [Epyc](https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/server/epyc.html).  
The use of smaller dies rather than one large monolithic die is beneficial for maximizing wafer yields as more dies can be fitted onto a single wafer. RDNA 3 uses two types of chiplets: the Graphics Compute Die (GCD) and Memory Cache Dies (MCDs).
