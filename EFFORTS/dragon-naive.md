# Dragon (Naive and CDP)

These suites appear to contain graph-processing kernels (likely from a “Dragon” graph library). In _dragon-naive_ we have:

- **testBfs**, **testAmr**, **testSssp**, **testJoin** (graph BFS, adaptive multi-resolution, single-source shortest paths, relational join)  
	 In _dragon-cdp_ (CUDA Dynamic Parallelism) the tests are:
	 
- **testBfs-cdp**, **testSssp-cdp** (BFS and SSSP using CDP)
