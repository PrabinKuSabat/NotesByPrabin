“In this chapter, we show that deep, architectural understanding is necessary to optimize software to its peak performance, and that the amount of performance left on the table without this understanding can be substantial.”

“Multiple authors [9, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] have shown areas for improved efficiency in the machine code emitted by the NVIDIA CUDA Compiler (NVCC) for architectures preceding Volta. Authors have also shown that knowledge of instruction encoding and microarchitectural behavior is necessary to achieve this full potential.”

“We extend this line of research to Volta: we show that opportunities for improving performance still exist in code emitted by the NVCC compiler for the Volta architecture, and we demonstrate how to exploit them with the help of a minimal example.”
